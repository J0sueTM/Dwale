# Dwale

#### _An open source, efficiency focused game framework_

# Clone

Remember that dwale has vendors and submodules.

```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/J0sueTM/Dwale.git
```

If you don't want the development branch:

```sh
$ git clone --recursive --branch stable https://github.com/J0sueTM/Dwale.git
```

If you want to add dwale as a submodule:

```sh
$ git submodule add https://github.com/J0sueTM/Dwale.git vendor/Dwale
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Install

There is already a premake5 workspace ready to use.

* Linux
Any gnu make works perfect.
  ```sh
  $ premake5 *
  
  # * = The generated file type. Whether gmake or gmake2
  #   | gmake
  #   | gmake2

  $ make # for compiling
  ```
  
* Unix
I haven't tested on unix yet. However, I don't think it differs that much from linux. Please open a PR or an issue if there's something wrong.
  ```sh
  $ premake5 *
  
  # * = The generated file type. For mac os I recommend:
  #   | gmake
  #   | gmake2
  #   | xcode4

  $ make # for compiling
  ```
  
* Windows
I recommend using Visual Studio. I haven't tested with any other IDE or compiler.
  ```batch
  $ premake5 *
 
  :: * = The version of your Visual Studio.
